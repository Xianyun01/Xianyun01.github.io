Stronghold8.github.io로 링크 이전 완료<br>
Moved to Stronghold8.github.io<br><br>

Stronghold is just to make the site name separate from my user name (I just wanted to name it Stronghold).<br>
So all the contents will still be uploaded on my Github and just be shown on the Stronghold.<br>
In short,
<li>Xianyun01 = My main account, all the projects uploaded</li>
<li>Stronghold8 = My sub account to manage the Github Page, projects will be shown but that will link to my main account Xianyun01</li>
